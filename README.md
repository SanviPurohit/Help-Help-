Hey everyone!
I recently created a game "Help Help" which is identical to the Chromes Dino Game with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Instead of Dino I have taken Iron Man and Thanos as the characters of the game.
It is a very beginner friendly project.
I Hope it will be helpfull for many beginners.
